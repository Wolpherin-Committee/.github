# Wolpherin

Wolpherin is a social platform that mainly served the students or alumni of WFLA.

## Our Goal

When creating this platform, we consider it to be: 

FREE in speech
We will do NO speech control
Democratic
Everyone is FREE to deliver their advice for this platform or vote for othersâ€™ advice. We will improve this platform based on them.

## Login and Registration

In principle, the users of this platform should be students or alumni of WFLA. If you are a student or alumnus, contact us to get your username and temporary password.

If you are not, you can join by entering the invitation code.

## Account Safety

In this platform, your password will be one-way encrypted. And all speech will be encrypted in the database.

## Open Source

To fulfill our dedication to creating a free space for every user, all the code of this platform (including both frontend and backend) will be open-sourced except for the server port and encryption key to avoid security troubles.

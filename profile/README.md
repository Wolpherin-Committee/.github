# Wolpherin

Wolpherin is a social platform that mainly served the students and alumni of WFLA.

## Our Goal

When creating this platform, we consider it to be: 

- FREE in speech
  - We will do NO speech control
- Democratic
  - Everyone is FREE to deliver their advice for this platform or vote for othersâ€™ advice. We will improve this platform based on them.
  - Our progress will be exhibited in: https://trello.com/b/LCE4HBYD/wolpherin-demandlist

## Login and Registration

In principle, the users of this platform should be students or alumni of WFLA, who can talk in the "Nameless BBS", have the permission create groups and have invitation codes (5 code for each user). If you are a student or alumnus, contact us to get your username and temporary password.

If you are not, you can join by entering the invitation code from us directly or some other WFLA student or alumnus, but you may not use the "Nameless BBS" nor creating groups. You will not have invitation code.

## Account Safety

In this platform, your password will be one-way encrypted.

All speech will be encrypted in the database.

## Open Source

To fulfill our dedication to creating a free space for every user, all the code of this platform (including both frontend and backend) will be open-sourced except for the server port and encryption key to avoid security troubles.
